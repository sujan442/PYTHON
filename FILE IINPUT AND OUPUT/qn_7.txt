n the dense forests of the east, a mischievous monkey swung from branch to branch, chattering noisily as it watched the sunrise. Not far away, a tired donley trudged along the narrow path, burdened by heavy sacks of grain. The villagers often relied on the donley for transportation, despite its slow pace. Suddenly, a shonkey—a creature rarely seen—dashed across the trail, startling both the monkey and the donley. The shonkey, known for its speed and strange cries, disappeared into the thickets as quickly as it had come. The monkey resumed its swinging, and the donley continued walking, but the memory of that shonkey stayed with them for the rest of the day.Python is good Python
